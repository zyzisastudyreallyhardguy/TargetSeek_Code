| PCSK9 | PCSK9 in a plasma protein that triggers increased degradation of the LDL receptor. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 reduce LDL receptor levels in the liver, leading to higher levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. | Protease (Enzyme) | Mainly expressed in liver, also found in intestines, kidneys and central nervous system. | The degradation of LDL receptors by PCSK9 leads to higher levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. | [1] |
| PCSK9 | PCSK9 also plays a role in modulating the secretion of lipoproteins and may influence lipid metabolism in various cardiovascular cells. | Protease (Enzyme) | Liver, intestines, kidneys, CNS | PCSK9 exacerbates lipid deposition and inflammation in arterial walls, both of which are key factors in the development of atherosclerosis. | [2] |
| PCSK9 | PCSK9 stimulates Syk, PKCδ, and NF-κB, leading to inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis. | Protease (Enzyme) | Cardiovascular tissue | By promoting inflammation via specific signaling pathways, PCSK9 directly contributes to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. | [3] |

Rationale:
PCSK9 is involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism, primarily through its interaction with LDL receptors. The degradation of LDL receptors caused by PCSK9 results in elevated LDL cholesterol levels, a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Furthermore, PCSK9 influences inflammation and plaque formation in arterial walls, providing a direct mechanistic link to atherosclerosis.

Conclusion:
The function of PCSK9 in degrading LDL receptors and its role in promoting inflammatory responses in arterial tissues are significant in understanding its contribution to atherosclerosis. This makes PCSK9 a crucial target for therapeutic intervention to manage atherosclerosis.
