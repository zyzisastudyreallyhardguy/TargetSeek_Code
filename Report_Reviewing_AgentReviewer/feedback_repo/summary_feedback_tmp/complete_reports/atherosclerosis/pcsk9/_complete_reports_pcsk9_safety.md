### Summary of Safety Profile of PCSK9 Inhibitors and Gene Manipulation

#### Safety Profile in Approved Drugs Targeting PCSK9

1. **Safety of PCSK9 Inhibitors**:
   - **General Safety Profile**: PCSK9 inhibitors, such as alirocumab and evolocumab, generally exhibit a good safety profile. Common adverse events include musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, local injection site reactions, and mild-to-moderate adverse events, but serious safety concerns are rare within the clinical data.

2. **Specific Drug Safety Reports**:
   - **Alirocumab**: The safety profile of alirocumab was very similar to that of a matching placebo, except for a slight increase in local injection site reactions.
     - Reference: "The safety profile of alirocumab was indistinguishable from matching placebo except for a 1.7% absolute increase in local injection site reactions." ([Source](https://academic.oup.com/ehjcvp/article/10/4/342/7657797))

   - **Evolocumab**: Evolocumab exhibits good safety and tolerability, with predominantly mild to moderate adverse events.
     - Reference: "...Evolocumab reportedly exhibit good safety and tolerability, along with predominantly mild-to-moderate adverse events (AEs)..." ([Source](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.15460))

3. **Drug Safety in Clinical and Gene Editing Trials**:
   - Research and clinical trials involving gene editing and small interfering RNA targeting PCSK9 have shown varying results. Specifically, concerns have emerged regarding the safety of using advanced gene-editing techniques like CRISPR.

#### Adversary Phenotype of Target Gene Knockout Mice

| Gene name | Safety issues have been reported in clinic | Human disease or traits linked to target gene mutation | Adversary Phenotype of target gene knockout mice (In addition to desired therapeutic effects) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PCSK9** | 1. Safety confirmed in several studies, with mild to moderate adverse effects reported.                                                                                                                                                      | 1. Family history of hypercholesterolemia implicated with PCSK9 mutations<br>2. Adverse cardiovascular effects in some gene-edited treatments.<br>3. PCSK9 mutations impact cholesterol metabolism and increase CVD risks. | 1. **Microvascular dysfunction**: PCSK9 knockout mice displayed increased incidence of microvascular dysfunction.<br>2. **Atherosclerosis-related genes**: Upregulation of genes linked to cardiovascular conditions in knockout models. |

### Rationale
Based on various experimental and clinical data, it is apparent that PCSK9 inhibitors offer a generally safe profile with predominant mild to moderate adverse effects. However, gene editing programs concerning PCSK9 have shown varying results and raised safety concerns. Knockout mice studies portrayed increased risks related to cardiovascular diseases and microvascular dysfunctions, highlighting the need for meticulous safety evaluations in therapeutic applications targeting PCSK9.
 
### Conclusion
While PCSK9 inhibitors are considered relatively safe in clinical use, the risk profiles for gene-editing therapies targeting PCSK9 demand further thorough investigations. Careful consideration must be given to the potential adverse effects before introducing novel therapeutic strategies into regular clinical practice.
