Based on the search results, I have compiled the details of currently reported clinical and pre-clinical drug pipelines targeting the gene PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) for the treatment of atherosclerosis across different modalities: small molecules, antibodies, and siRNA.

### Small Molecules

| Small Molecule Pipeline/Program | Testing Drug Molecule | Current Pipeline/Program Status | Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria | Endpoint | Trial Results | Reference | Targeted Protein | Aligned |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| AZD0780 | AZD0780 (Small Molecule) | Phase 1 | Hypercholesterolemia patients | LDL-C reduction | Positive Phase 1 results presented | [1] | PCSK9 | Yes |
| MK-0616 | MK-0616 (Small Molecule) | Phase 2b | Hypercholesterolemia patients | LDL-C reduction | Positive Phase 2b results reported | [2] | PCSK9 | Yes |
| Natural Phytochemicals Study | Various (Small Molecule) | Pre-Clinical | Pre-clinical models of hypercholesterolemia | LDL-C reduction, atherosclerosis markers | Ongoing | [3] | PCSK9 | Yes |

### Antibodies

| Antibody Pipeline/Program | Testing Drug Molecule | Current Pipeline/Program Status | Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria | Endpoint | Trial Results | Reference | Targeted Protein | Aligned |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Alirocumab | Alirocumab (Antibody) | Approved, ongoing trials in various phases | Hypercholesterolemia patients | LDL-C reduction, cardiovascular outcomes | Positive outcomes in reducing LDL-C and cardiovascular events | [4] [5] | PCSK9 | Yes |
| Evolocumab | Evolocumab (Antibody) | Approved, ongoing trials in various phases | Hypercholesterolemia patients | LDL-C reduction, cardiovascular outcomes | Positive outcomes in reducing LDL-C and cardiovascular events | [4] [5] | PCSK9 | Yes |

### siRNA

| siRNA Pipeline/Program | Testing Drug Molecule | Current Pipeline/Program Status | Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria | Endpoint | Trial Results | Reference | Targeted Protein | Aligned |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Inclisiran | Inclisiran (siRNA) | Approved, Phase 3 ongoing | Hypercholesterolemia patients | LDL-C reduction | Successful Phase 3 results, achieved LDL-C reduction | [6] [7] | PCSK9 | Yes |
| RN0191 | RN0191 (siRNA) | Phase 1 | Healthy volunteers for initial safety | LDL-C reduction | Positive Phase 1 results presented | [8] | PCSK9 | Yes |

### Rationale
The rationale behind inhibiting PCSK9 is to prevent the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby enhancing the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream, which is a primary risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis.

### Conclusion
Each category of drugs targeting PCSK9, including small molecules, antibodies, and siRNA, has shown promising potential in clinical trials. The highest phase reached includes:
- **Small molecules:** Phase 2b (MK-0616)
- **Antibodies:** Approved and ongoing in various phases (Alirocumab, Evolocumab)
- **siRNA:** Phase 3 (Inclisiran)
