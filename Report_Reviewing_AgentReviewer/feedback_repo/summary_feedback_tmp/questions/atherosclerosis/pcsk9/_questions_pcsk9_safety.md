3. Are you sure that the quoted text from the "Safety and Tolerability of PCSK9 Inhibitors" source is accurately represented and relevant?
4. Are you sure the adverse cardiovascular effects are correctly linked to PCSK9 mutations as listed in the Human disease or traits linked to target gene mutation section of the table?
5. Are you sure that the safety profile presented for alirocumab, including the 1.7% absolute increase in local injection site reactions, is accurate and sourced correctly?
6. Are you sure that evolocumab’s good safety and tolerability, as reported in the "Specific Drug Safety Reports" section, is accurately cited from the provided source?
7. Are you sure the quoted references and sources about gene editing and PCSK9, particularly regarding the halted trial due to safety concerns, are up to date and correctly depicted?
8. Are you sure the phenotype traits listed under "Microvascular dysfunction" and "Atherosclerosis-related genes" for PCSK9 knockout mice are accurate and appropriately referenced?
9. Are you sure that the claimed link between PCSK9 knockout mice and the increased incidence of microvascular dysfunction is accurate and correctly attributed in the table?
10. Are you sure that the source stating “All these genes were upregulated in aortas of PCSK9DY-positive mice” accurately reflects the study's findings and links to the reference correctly?
