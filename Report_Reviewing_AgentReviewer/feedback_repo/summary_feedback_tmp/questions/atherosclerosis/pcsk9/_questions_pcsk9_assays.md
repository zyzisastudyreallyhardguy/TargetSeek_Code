1. Are you sure that THP-1-derived macrophages are the most appropriate cell model for a PCSK9/LDLR binding assay?
2. Are you sure the competitive ELISA binding assay can directly measure PCSK9 levels without any interference?
3. Are you sure that CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency can be reliably measured only in liver tissue for PCSK9 knockout?
4. Are you sure that PCSK9 can be effectively measured using immunohistochemistry in atherosclerotic plaque tissue?
5. Are you sure that histological staining is the most reliable method for measuring atherosclerotic plaque area?
6. Are you sure that autophagic flux is a disease-relevant readout for PCSK9/LDLR binding assays?
7. Are you sure nanoliposomal PCSK9 vaccines have been validated in C57BL/6 mouse models for atherosclerosis studies?
8. Are you sure the reference [7] is correct for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout efficiency check in liver tissue?
9. Are you sure the atherosclerotic plaque area and LDL-C levels are the best indicators for measuring the efficacy of PCSK9 modulation?
10. Are you sure that the references cited are all correctly linked to the experiments described?
