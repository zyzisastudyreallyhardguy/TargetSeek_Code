1. Are you sure PCSK9 is highly expressed in the liver and detected in multiple tissues?
2. Are you sure PCSK9 is a secreted protein and not an intracellular protein?
3. Are you sure the crystal structure of PCSK9 is available at a resolution of 2.3 Ã…?
4. Are you sure PCSK9 is not a membrane-bound protein?
5. Are you sure PCSK9 binds to ligands, including the LDL receptor?
6. Are you sure PCSK9 has been co-crystallized with small molecules in PDB?
7. Are you sure the small molecule tool compounds mentioned (Compound 16, E28362, AZD0780) are effective inhibitors of PCSK9?
8. Are you sure the references listed correctly support each of the claims made about PCSK9?
9. Are you sure that RNA-based therapies, such as Inclisiran, target PCSK9 mRNA to reduce its production?
10. Are you sure the proteins and small molecules explicitly interact as described in the submitted report?
