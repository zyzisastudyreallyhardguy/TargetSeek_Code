#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Gene Name**: PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9)

2. **Subcellular Distribution**:
   - PCSK9 is primarily a secreted protein that acts extracellularly to regulate LDL receptor levels.

3. **Tissue and Cell Type-Specific Expression**:
   - PCSK9 is highly expressed in the liver, but also detected in other tissues such as the intestine, kidneys, and central nervous system. This wide tissue distribution facilitates its systemic effects on cholesterol homeostasis.

4. **Protein Structure**:
   - The crystal structure of PCSK9 is available at 2.3 Å resolution. Detailed structural information allows precise targeting via small-molecule inhibitors or biologics.

5. **Membrane Protein Status**:
   - PCSK9 itself is not membrane-bound but interacts with membrane receptors such as the LDL receptor. This interaction is crucial for its function.

6. **Ligand Binding Capability**:
   - PCSK9 binds to ligands, including its primary interaction partner, the LDL receptor, making it a feasible target for ligand-based inhibition strategies.

7. **Small Molecule Interaction**:
   - Evidence shows that PCSK9 can bind small molecules in its receptor-binding domains. Small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9 are being explored and some have advanced to clinical studies.

8. **Binding Pockets**:
   - Structural studies have identified binding pockets on PCSK9, including the LDL receptor interaction interface, supporting the development of compounds targeting these pockets.

9. **Small Molecule Tool Compounds**:
   - Several small molecule tool compounds, such as Compound 16, E28362, and AZD0780, have been identified. These compounds have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies for inhibiting PCSK9.

### Suitable Therapeutic Modalities

1. **Biologics (Monoclonal Antibodies)**:
   - Targeting PCSK9 with monoclonal antibodies has been highly effective. These antibodies can specifically bind to PCSK9, preventing its interaction with the LDL receptor, thereby maintaining higher levels of functional LDL receptors on hepatocytes and lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels.
   - **Examples**: Evolocumab, Alirocumab

2. **Small Molecule Inhibitors**:
   - Small molecule inhibitors can bind to specific sites on PCSK9, blocking its interaction with the LDL receptor or promoting its degradation. The availability of its crystal structure facilitates the design of such molecules.
   - **Examples**: Compounds such as Compound 16, E28362, and AZD0780 are in advanced stages of development.

3. **Gene Therapy**:
   - Gene editing technologies like CRISPR can be used to knock out or modify the PCSK9 gene to reduce its expression, providing a potentially long-term solution for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

4. **RNA-based Therapies**:
   - Antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PCSK9 mRNA can reduce the production of PCSK9 in the liver, thereby decreasing its activity.
   - **Example**: Inclisiran

### Conclusion

Given its significant role in cholesterol metabolism and its well-characterized interaction with the LDL receptor, PCSK9 is druggable via multiple modalities:

- **Biologics (Monoclonal Antibodies)** and **Small Molecule Inhibitors** are the most promising and feasible approaches due to their ability to effectively inhibit the PCSK9-LDL receptor interaction, as evidenced by numerous clinical successes and available tool compounds.
- **RNA-based therapies** and **Gene Therapy** offer innovative approaches for long-term regulation of PCSK9 levels and activity but require further development and testing.
