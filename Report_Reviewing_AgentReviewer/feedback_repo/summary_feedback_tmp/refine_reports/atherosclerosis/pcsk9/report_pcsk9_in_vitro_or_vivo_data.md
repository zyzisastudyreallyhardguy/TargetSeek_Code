Based on the collected information, here is a summary of the experimental evidence supporting the involvement of the PCSK9 gene in atherosclerosis:

| Gene name | Experimental evidence | Clinical Trial/Cell/Animal Model Used | Key Results | Reference |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **PCSK9** | Study 1: Recent Update on PCSK9 and Platelet Activation Experimental | In vitro and in vivo models using isolated platelets and animal models | Beyond its lipid-lowering effect, PCSK9 also mediates platelet activation, which contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis. | [1](https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/9/8/258) |
|           | Study 2: Pharmacological modulation of LDL receptor by small interfering RNA and antibodies anti-PCSK9 | In vitro study on hepatocytes | Pharmacological modulation of LDL receptor by PCSK9 inhibitors shows enhanced LDL uptake by hepatocytes, which can reduce atherosclerosis risk. | [2](https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(24)00392-7/abstract) |
|           | Study 3: The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) in human atherosclerotic plaques | In vitro and in vivo studies on vascular smooth muscle cells and human plaques | PCSK9 secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells and within plaques reduces LDL receptor levels, contributing to atherosclerotic processes. | [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1431398/full) |
|           | Study 4: Pleiotropic Effects of PCSK9 Inhibitors on Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease | In vivo studies in mice models and human clinical studies | PCSK9 inhibitors exhibit pleiotropic effects that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in addition to lowering LDL-C levels. | [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/12/2729) |
|           | Study 5: Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) Triggers Apoptosis in Human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Smooth Muscle Cells | In vivo and in vitro studies on human and mouse models | PCSK9 promotes apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to the instability of atherosclerotic plaques. | [5](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.316902) |
|           | Study 6: Gene Therapy Targeting PCSK9 | In vitro and in vivo gene editing studies | Gene editing targeting PCSK9 splice sites shows potential for reducing cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis. | [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8781734/) |
|           | Study 7: PCSK9 Imperceptibly Affects Chemokine Receptor Expression In Vivo | In vivo studies in murine models | PCSK9's inflammatory effects are largely independent of chemokine receptors, indicating alternate pathways in atherosclerosis. | [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884827/) |

### Rationale:
The body of evidence from various controlled in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrates that PCSK9 plays a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. PCSK9 affects LDL receptor levels, lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, all of which are critical factors in atherosclerosis.

### Conclusion:
Expression and action of PCSK9 contribute significantly to atherosclerosis through multiple pathways involving lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and stability of atherosclerotic plaques. This makes PCSK9 a promising target for therapeutic interventions to treat or prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
